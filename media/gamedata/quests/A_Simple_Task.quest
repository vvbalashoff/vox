A Simple Task|Hello there brave adventurer, my name is [C=Custom(00A2E8)]Melinda The Witch[C=White] and I have stumbled across a 'valuable treasure'. I can give you this treasure if you will do a quest for me...
I need you to kill these pesky [C=Red]slimes[C=White] that are overrunning this place. If you do this for me, the treasure is yours. What do you say?|You have completed the quest, and destroyed the sliminess of these lands, well done!|You are already on a quest, come back to me once you have finished.|1|Kill 5 Slimes|1|5|1|0|0|0|nullptr|nullptr|0|0|0|0|0|0|nullptr|nullptr|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
